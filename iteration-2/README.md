## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create a static Angular application with Angular CLI.
- Build an Angular application with one component.
- Build an Angular application with two nested components.
- Build an Angular application using nested iterators.

## Requirements

- [Fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
- Clone your fork into your `~/code/labs` folder.

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m"done"
$ git push origin master
```

Navigate to your repo and create a Pull Request -from your master branch to the original repository master branch.

In the Pull Request name, add your campus, name, and last name separated by a dash "-".

## Deliverables

All the files in the different folders you have, being these folders one per iteration.

## Introduction

In this lesson we are going to work with Angular 2 for the first time. The goal here is to work over three small projects where you are going to practice all what we have learnt.

### Starter Code

The starter code is composed of three different folders, called `iteration-1`, `iteration-2`, `iteration-3`. The only folder that has something inside is the `iteration-1` folder, that contains a project created with the Angular CLI.

As you may noticed, this lesson is composed of three different iterations. In each iteration we will cover a different project. In the first iteration we provide you the basic skeleton of the app, while in the other two iterations you will have to create it.

## Iteration #1: Photo Album

In the first iteration we are going to build a photo album. Imagine you have an album at home. On it, you can find a photo and its description. This is what we are going to build.

We will build this album over the `AppComponent` component. The album will have three photos and their descriptions, and **it's not necessary to have an Array to store this values**.

Easy, right? Add some styles to the page to see the different photos as better as you can show them :)

## Iteration #2: Article with comments

In the second project of this lesson we are going to create a blog article with comments. We are going to create two different components:

- The `main` component will contain the article, composed by a `title`, an `image`, and a `description`.
- The `comments` component, that will contain several comments (feel free to add as many comments as you want).

At the bottom of the comments, we will add a comment form to add some reality to our article. We can't have comments without a form!

The first thing you will have to do is to generate the project with `Angular CLI`.

## Iteration #3: NBA Champions

Last, but not least, we are going to create a Dashboard with the last NBA Champions. In this case, we will need to create one component, that will contain an array of Championships, with the following fields:

- `year` of the championship.
- Name of the `champion` team.
- A `champion_url` to show the team badge.
- A list with the best players of the champion team, called `best_players`

You can find the full list of [NBA Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions) in wikipedia. In our application we have to show, at least, three of them. The result could be something like that:

<!-- :::info -->
**Note** that we are iterating over two different arrays to show all the information: `Championships` and `best_players` of every team.

/Happy coding!
