  spaceVisionText ='People all around the world have experienced a sense of awe as they look up at the night sky. We discover a limitless universe of wonder as we learn to identify the Milky Way, or to spot planets, rings, moons, and even entire galaxies. As we peer into the heavens we look back billions of years in time, and connect simultaneously with the most primal thoughts of our ancestors and the most cutting-edge science of our day. Sending humans and satellites into space requires effort, money, dedication, and sacrifice. In an imperfect world with pressing and important problems, some people ask why space is worth it. It is a reasonable question. Just do not expect a single answer! After all, space is nearly infinite, and that boundless expanse gives us so many reasons to explore space. Modern life would be unrecognizable without satellites. Meteorologists make life-saving weather predictions. Humanitarian organizations track the movements of genocidal military forces and coordinate relief efforts after national disasters. Farmers improve crop yields, and governments monitor and prevent illegal fishing and logging. Scientists and policy makers learn the answers to key questions about our planetâ€™s climate.'
